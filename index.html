<p>As a software engineer with experience in backend development, I have a strong understanding of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem. I have experience working with languages such as Java and Kotlin, as well as frameworks such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Java/Jakarta EE. Additionally, I have experience with tools such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Linux, Jenkins, and databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle and MongoDB. I am familiar with test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD)</p>
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I have also had the opportunity to serve as a staff engineer, where I gained experience in planning and developing software architectures, including microservices architecture, event-driven architecture, and hexagonal architecture</p>
<p>I  am always interested in expanding my knowledge and skills, and am currently exploring Quarkus, Gin and Golang</p>
